# Firefox Lockbox for Desktop Release Notes

## 2.1.0-alpha

_Date: 2019-04-19_

Building from the original experiment, this release gives you access to  -- and control over -- your logins already saved in Firefox.

### What's New

* Uses the same data storage backend as Firefox!  View, create, change, and delete your logins here and have those changes take effect immediately in Firefox.
* Uses the same account backend as Firefox!  Your profile information shown here is always the same as the one you've signed into Firefox.
* Interested in better access on your Android or iOS device?  Click the "learn more" links throughout to get more information and instructions on how to get Lockbox for your phone or tablet.

## What's Fixed

* You are now alerted to validation errors; missing a password, missing a website address, or accidentally adding the same login a second time.

## Breaking Changes

This version no longer uses its own data store; any logins previously saved in Lockbox are lost.

### Known Issues

* Sometimes, the "This is a duplicate entry" error bubble is not properly dismissed.  However, changes are still saved.
* The profile menu action to "Connect another device" doesn't do anything yet.
